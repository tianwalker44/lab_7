  abstract = {Recent data on prevalence, awareness, treatment, and risk factors of diabetes in China is necessary for interventional efforts. To estimate trends in prevalence, awareness, treatment, and risk factors of diabetes in China based on national data. Cross-sectional nationally representative survey data collected in adults aged 18 years or older in mainland China from 170 287 participants in the 2013-2014 years and 173 642 participants in the 2018-2019 years. Fasting plasma glucose and hemoglobin A1c levels were measured for all participants. A 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test was conducted for all participants without diagnosed diabetes. Primary outcomes were diabetes and prediabetes defined according to American Diabetes Association criteria. Secondary outcomes were awareness, treatment, and control of diabetes and prevalence of risk factors. A hemoglobin A1c level of less than 7.0\% (53 mmol/mol) among treated patients with diabetes was considered adequate glycemic control. In 2013, the median age was 55.8 years (IQR, 46.4-65.2 years) and the weighted proportion of women was 50.0\%; in 2018, the median age was 51.3 years (IQR, 42.1-61.6 years), and the weighted proportion of women was 49.5\%. The estimated prevalence of diabetes increased from 10.9\% (95\% CI, 10.4\%-11.5\%) in 2013 to 12.4\% (95\% CI, 11.8\%-13.0\%) in 2018 (P ¡ .001). The estimated prevalence of prediabetes was 35.7\% (95\% CI, 34.2\%-37.3\%) in 2013 and 38.1\% (95\% CI, 36.4\%-39.7\%) in 2018 (P = .07). In 2018, among adults with diabetes, 36.7\% (95\% CI, 34.7\%-38.6\%) reported being aware of their condition, and 32.9\% (95\% CI, 30.9\%-34.8\%) reported being treated; 50.1\% (95\% CI, 47.5\%-52.6\%) of patients receiving treatment were controlled adequately. These rates did not change significantly from 2013. From 2013 to 2018, low physical activity, high intake of red meat, overweight, and obesity significantly increased in prevalence. In this survey study, the estimated diabetes prevalence was high and increased from 2013 to 2018. There was no significant improvement in the estimated prevalence of adequate treatment.},

  abstract = {Blood pressure is characterized by short-term and long-term fluctuations, which are the result of complex interactions between environmental and behavioural factors, on the one side, and cardiovascular regulatory mechanisms on the other. Increased blood pressure variability (BPV) leads to cardiac, vascular, and renal damage and has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Parati et al. review the mechanisms, assessment and prognostic importance of BPV. They also address the question of whether BPV should be a target for antihypertensive treatment in the prevention of cardiovascular disease. Blood pressure (BP) is characterized by marked short-term fluctuations occurring within a 24 h period (beat-to-beat, minute-to-minute, hour-to-hour, and day-to-night changes) and also by long-term fluctuations occurring over more-prolonged periods of time (days, weeks, months, seasons, and even years). Rather than representing 'background noise' or a randomly occurring phenomenon, these variations have been shown to be the result of complex interactions between extrinsic environmental and behavioural factors and intrinsic cardiovascular regulatory mechanisms. Although the adverse cardiovascular consequences of hypertension largely depend on absolute BP values, evidence from observational studies and post-hoc analyses of data from clinical trials have indicated that these outcomes might also depend on increased BP variability (BPV). Increased short-term and long-term BPV are associated with the development, progression, and severity of cardiac, vascular, and renal damage and with an increased risk of cardiovascular events and mortality. Of particular interest are the findings from post-hoc analyses of large intervention trials in hypertension, showing that within-patient visit-to-visit BPV is strongly prognostic for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. This result has prompted discussion on whether antihypertensive treatment should be targeted not only towards reducing mean BP levels but also to stabilizing BPV with the aim of achieving consistent BP control over time, which might favour cardiovascular protection. Blood-pressure variability (BPV) is a complex phenomenon that includes short-term fluctuations occurring within a 24 h period as well as blood pressure changes over more-prolonged periods of timeThe underlying mechanisms, clinical significance, and prognostic implications differ between types of BPV; thus, when interpreting BPV, the method and time interval of its measurement should be taken into accountMounting evidence indicates that the adverse cardiovascular consequences of high blood pressure could also be the result of increased BPV, and not only of elevation of mean blood pressure valuesShort-term and long-term BPV are independently associated with the development, progression, and severity of cardiac, vascular, and renal damage and with an increased risk of cardiovascular events and mortalityPost-hoc analyses of large intervention trials in patients with hypertension have shown that intraindividual and interindividual visit-to-visit BPVs are strong predictors of cardiovascular morbidity and mortalityWhether treatment with antihypertensive agents should be targeted towards stabilizing BPV in addition to controlling mean blood pressure values, to achieve maximum cardiovascular protection, is uncertain Blood-pressure variability (BPV) is a complex phenomenon that includes short-term fluctuations occurring within a 24 h period as well as blood pressure changes over more-prolonged periods of time The underlying mechanisms, clinical significance, and prognostic implications differ between types of BPV; thus, when interpreting BPV, the method and time interval of its measurement should be taken into account Mounting evidence indicates that the adverse cardiovascular consequences of high blood pressure could also be the result of increased BPV, and not only of elevation of mean blood pressure values Short-term and long-term BPV are independently associated with the development, progression, and severity of cardiac, vascular, and renal damage and with an increased risk of cardiovascular events and mortality Post-hoc analyses of large intervention trials in patients with hypertension have shown that intraindividual and interindividual visit-to-visit BPVs are strong predictors of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality Whether treatment with antihypertensive agents should be targeted towards stabilizing BPV in addition to controlling mean blood pressure values, to achieve maximum cardiovascular protection, is uncertain}

Inflammation has an important role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and associated complications. Clinical studies have demonstrated that interleukin-1 (IL-1) antagonists, salsalate and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists improve glucose metabolism. Anti-inflammatory drugs may have disease-modifying and long-lasting effects. Future genetic and biomarker studies may profile responders to a specific anti-inflammatory treatment. Combining or sequentially using multiple anti-inflammatory drugs may provide a tailored solution for treating patients with type 2 diabetes. Inflammation is now appreciated to have an important role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and associated complications. Donath describes the underlying mechanisms and discusses the rationale for the use of anti-inflammatory agents — such as those that have been developed for rheumatoid arthritis and other diseases driven by inflammatory processes — in patients with diabetes. The role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and associated complications is now well established. Several conditions that are driven by inflammatory processes are also associated with diabetes, including rheumatoid arthritis, gout, psoriasis and Crohn's disease, and various anti-inflammatory drugs have been approved or are in late stages of development for the treatment of these conditions. This Review discusses the rationale for the use of some of these anti-inflammatory treatments in patients with diabetes and what we could expect from their use. Future immunomodulatory treatments may not target a specific disease, but could instead act on a dysfunctional pathway that causes several conditions associated with the metabolic syndrome.},
